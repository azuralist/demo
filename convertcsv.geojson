This process, together with existing checkout and transfer processes will cover NMT faculty and staff. However, during the development of the report it was determined that the checkout and transfer procedures for student employees with Banner update access was not adequate. ITC is working with the Payroll Office to establish a procedure to use Banner to automate termination of user rights for students. This procedure will be reviewed by the appropriate administrative offices for suitability and effectiveness and then be tested.

Regarding the audit recommendation, with the hiring of a new individual in Sponsored Programs, the Institute is now capable of having someone other than the preparer of the endowment calculations to provide a detailed review of the annual donor statements. While the approval and distribution of the final donor statements will most likely remain an Advancement function, annual donor statements would not be submitted for distribution until the detailed review takes place. The Institute updated its Investment Policy in June 2017. This updated policy was approved by the Board of Regents. The Institute is also in the process of significantly updating the related investment and distribution procedures. The new investment procedures will include regularly scheduled portfolio rebalancing and regular reviews of the institutional asset allocation strategy.

Although actual amounts spent may have been in excess of the approved budgeted amount there were funds available to cover the expenditures meaning there were no true cost overruns. Budget to actual reviews were performed throughout the fiscal year and a mid-year Budget Adjustment Request was prepared to add budgetary authority to these two specific areas, however the adjustments were short of what was required. In the future, management will continue to review budget to actual figures on an interim basis through the use of newly developed quarterly reporting reviews which will encompass all expenditure areas. Any issues identified as a result of these reviews will be researched and considered for a mid-year budget adjustment request. Methods of forecasting year-to-date data will also be refined and updated. Implemented in FY18.",

Since the Department recently implemented the uFACTS system and it was the first of its kind among other states, the Department continues to test the various transaction processing of the system and, as a result, has identified system deficiencies, which the Department continues to address. During the period under audit, the following are the most significant issues identified as it relates to the financial reporting and accounting of the UI fund: \n\n• The Department lacks procedures to reconcile all activity and balances of the UI fund as reported in SHARE on a monthly basis. As a result, certain material audit and client identified adjustments were required as of June 30, 2017. \n\n• The Department lacks the ability to generate the necessary reports from the uFACTS system to properly record taxes receivables at year end as well as estimate the collectability of those receivables. As a result, management of the Department and the auditors worked with the programmers to run various queries from the system to obtain the necessary information for the year-end closing entries. \n\n• The Department lacks the ability to generate the necessary reports from the uFACTS system that are required to accurately estimate the collectability of benefit overpayments.",
