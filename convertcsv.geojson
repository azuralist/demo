During the period under audit, the following are the most significant issues identified as it relates to the financial reporting and accounting of the UI fund: \n\nï¿½ The Department lacks procedures to reconcile all activity and balances of the UI fund as reported in SHARE on a monthly basis. As a result, certain material audit and client identified adjustments were required as of June 30, 2017. \n\nï¿½ The Department lacks the ability to generate the necessary reports from the uFACTS system to properly record taxes receivables at year end as well as estimate the collectability of those receivables. As a result, management of the Department and the auditors worked with the programmers to run various queries from the system to obtain the necessary information for the year-end closing entries. \n\nï¿½ The Department lacks the ability to generate the necessary reports from the uFACTS system that are required to accurately estimate the collectability of benefit overpayments.

This process, together with existing checkout and transfer processes will cover NMT faculty and staff. However, during the development of the report it was determined that the checkout and transfer procedures for student employees with Banner update access was not adequate. ITC is working with the Payroll Office to establish a procedure to use Banner to automate termination of user rights for students. This procedure will be reviewed by the appropriate administrative offices for suitability and effectiveness and then be tested. This two-pronged approach will resolve the issue of user rights termination for both faculty/staff and students. Estimated completion in FY18",
